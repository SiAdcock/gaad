# Global Accessibility Awareness Day – 15 May 2025

## Intro

Hello and welcome to the Guardian's event celebrating Global Accessibility Awareness Day 2025.

My name is Simon Adcock, I'm an Engineering Manager in Product & Engineering.

It's great to see so many people here today, thank you for coming down, and for those watching remotely, thank you for taking the time to join.

A bit of admin up front.

This meeting is being recorded, for internal use only. 

For remotees, please mute your mic unless you're speaking. If you unmute you will take centre stage.

Today's topic is accessibility, and how by learning and understanding the challenges of access, we can reach a wider range of readers.

We usually think of accessibility in terms of how easy it is to access physical spaces.

Accessible thinking also applies to the digital space. It’s the degree to which something, such as a website or app, is usable by as many people as possible. It’s about reaching more readers, creating better products, and building inclusive experiences that work for everyone.

Here's a quick rundown of what we'll be doing today.

- First we'll hear from Gavin Evans from the Digital Accessibility Centre. The DAC provide consulting, training and auditing to ensure digital media is accessible to everyone.
- Pete Johnson from Lloyds Banking Group will be joining us. Pete will give us a case study into how Lloyds, working with the DAC, have shifted left on accessibility and  deliver accessible solutions to their customers.
- We'll hear from one of the Guardian's own amazing Pip Burkett from the Editorial Design Team, explaining how the work on the UK elections was made accessible.
- A bit more from me at the end

## Introducing Gavin

But first, we go over to Gavin at the DAC. The DAC provide consulting, training and auditing to ensure digital media is accessible to everyone. They work with a large number of very high profile companies and government departments including the NHS, Channel 4, FT and the Guardian. Gavin has many years of experience, he's even delivered a talk at the O2, and he has prepared a wonderful introduction to accessibility for us today.

## Introducing Pip

Thank you Gavin and Pete.

We now go to Pip from the Editorial Design Team, who will talk about how the work on the UK elections was made accessible.

## Q&A

Thank you Pip.

Gavin, Pete and Pip will now take questions from the audience. If you have a question for our panel, please put your hand up.

We'll take a question from the room, then one from call.

For those in the room, we'll bring a mic over to you. Please don't ask the question until you have the mic, for the benefit of the recording and for remotees.

For those on the call, please don't unmute until we call upon you.

Thank you.
